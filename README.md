# üå¶Ô∏è Climatic Analysis & Impact on Groundwater Levels

**Duration:** May 2025 ‚Äì June 2025  
**Locations Covered:** Guwahati, Patna, Bhubaneswar

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates long-term climatic trends and their impact on groundwater levels in three Indian cities using historical temperature, rainfall, and groundwater datasets. The analysis integrates time series decomposition, trend detection, anomaly identification, and seasonal pattern analysis to uncover relationships between climate variability and water resource dynamics.

## Key Objectives

- **Trend Detection (1970‚Äì2020):**  
  - Analyzed monthly temperature and rainfall data to detect long-term trends using statistical tests.  
  - Applied **Sen‚Äôs Slope Estimator** and **Mann-Kendall Test** to assess direction and significance of trends.

- **Climatic Anomaly Identification:**  
  - Used **STL decomposition** to extract seasonal and residual components.  
  - Identified anomalous climatic events and regime shifts across decades.

- **Groundwater Response (1996‚Äì2017):**  
  - Studied seasonal groundwater level variations across pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon phases.  
  - Linked anomalies in climate with deviations in groundwater response.
